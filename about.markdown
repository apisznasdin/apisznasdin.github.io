Hi, I’m Hafidz Nasruddin — a System Administrator based in Putrajaya, currently working with Perbadanan Putrajaya on Smart City initiatives.

This blog is a reboot of my digital presence. I’m using it to document my journey back into programming, tech tinkering, and everything in between. I’ve always had a love for Linux, open source, and network security — and now I’m slowly reconnecting with those interests.

*Jekyll & Bytes* is my space to share notes, ideas, and experiments. Nothing fancy, just clean thoughts and quiet bytes.

Thanks for dropping by.
