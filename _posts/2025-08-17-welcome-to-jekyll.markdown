Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
This marks the reboot of my digital presence. Iâ€™m not entirely sure what Iâ€™ll be writing here yet, but Iâ€™m using this space to slowly polish back my interest in programming â€” something Iâ€™ve left behind for quite some time.


### Why Jekyll & GitHub Pages?
I chose Jekyll because itâ€™s simple, clean, and doesnâ€™t need a database. GitHub Pages makes it easy to host the site for free, with version control built-in.

### How I Started
1. Installed Jekyll:
   ```bash
   gem install jekyll bundler
   ```

2. Created a new site:
   ```bash
   jekyll new myblog
   cd myblog
   ```

3. Pushed it to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git init
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push -u origin master
   ```

4. Enabled GitHub Pages in repo settings. Done!

### Whatâ€™s Next
Iâ€™ll be customizing the layout with Material Design and writing about projects Iâ€™m involved in Putrajaya.

Thanks for dropping by. Letâ€™s see where this journey takes me â€” one byte at a time.
